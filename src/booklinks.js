      **The beginning of the journey**

      Have you ever dreamed of traveling to the past to see how dinosaurs lived? A girl named {name} didn't just dream about it—she believed it was possible.<!--split-->

      One evening, sitting in the cozy living room, {name}, along with her parents, Dad, and Mom, watched a dinosaur program through an AR projector, which made the ancient giants almost real, allowing them to literally walk through their room. The air was filled with magic as they saw in three-dimensional projection how these mighty creatures once ruled the Earth.<!--split-->

      Suddenly, a scientist appeared on the screen, who talked about how the dinosaurs perished. {name} was surprised and simultaneously saddened by the fate of these majestic beings. "How I wish I could see them alive!" she exclaimed when the program ended.<!--split-->

      At that moment, an ad for Astra Horizon flashed on the screen. "Embark on a journey to the age of dinosaurs with a discount!" the promise sounded. The advertisement showed happy tourists taking photos with friendly dinosaurs. {name}'s eyes sparkled with delight, and she immediately started convincing her parents to go on this adventure.<!--split-->

      "Please, let's go! It will be the most incredible adventure of my life!" {name} said enthusiastically. Dad and Mom exchanged glances. They saw how much their daughter wanted this journey and understood that such moments are priceless.<!--split-->

      "Alright," Dad said with a smile. "Let's check our calendars and plan your trip through time."<!--split-->

      Thus began {name}'s great adventure, which she would never forget. She was given the chance not only to see dinosaurs alive but also to touch the mysteries of the distant past.`,
      page4: `
      On the weekend morning, {name}'s house was filled with the anticipation of adventure. The family went to the office of Astra Horizon, where they were warmly greeted and registered {name} for an exciting tour into the past. The company's employees conducted a detailed briefing, explaining the safety rules and the importance of following the guides' instructions. {name} listened attentively, her eyes gleaming with excitement and joy.<!--split-->

      After the briefing, the family was led to a hangar, where shiny capsules—the Astra Horizon research probes—were located. These metallic structures with large glass panels promised a thrilling view of ancient landscapes.<!--split-->

      At this moment, {name}'s path and her parents separated: they stayed in the office to await their daughter's return.`,
      page5: `
      With excitement, {name} climbed into the probe, where she was helped to buckle up. Everything around seemed so unreal—from the cold metal of the capsule to the anticipated journey through time. After the countdown, the capsule came to life, and their movement into the past began.<!--split-->

      **In the Paths of the Triassic Period**

      When the tourist-laden probes landed, they found themselves 240 million years in the past. The staff at the base met them with another briefing and explained the tour program: starting from the Triassic period, moving through the Jurassic, and ending in the Cretaceous.<!--split-->

      This information made {name}'s heart beat even faster. She felt a surge of exhilaration and disbelief at what was happening. Being so close to a world she had only seen through screens and books felt like a dream.`,
      page6: `
      Looking around, {name} felt like an explorer of uncharted lands. The air was filled with an atmosphere of adventure and mysteries, every sound and movement around seemed an invitation to the world of ancient enigmas. She knew these experiences would be among the most vivid in her life.<!--split-->

      Before boarding the probe, each tourist was given a watch with an artificial intelligence named Roxy, who promised to be a reliable guide, historian, and friend for the entire tour.<!--split-->

      "Hello, {name}! You have such beautiful eyes, I'm almost sure they shine brighter than my screen," Roxy's cheerful voice sounded from the watch. {name} couldn't help but smile, listening to the compliment from the artificial intelligence.`,
      page7: `
      As she settled into her probe, which instantly became invisible, {name} felt like she was part of something magical and incredible. The journey to the Triassic period had begun, and Roxy immediately got down to business, sharing fascinating facts about that time.<!--split-->

      "Did you know that the Triassic period lasted about 50 million years and was a time when it could rain for almost 2 million years straight? Can you imagine how many umbrellas you would have needed?" `,
      page8: `
      Roxy joked, and {name} laughed, imagining that scenario.<!--split-->

      "The continent at that time was called Pangaea, and it was kind of like a party for all the creatures on the planet—all in one place!" Roxy continued, adding lightness to the story of ancient times.<!--split-->

      As Roxy began to talk about the emergence of the first mammals, ammonites, and belemnites, {name} was amazed by the diversity of life. But the real excitement came when they encountered an Eoraptor—one of the first dinosaurs.<!--split-->

      "And now meet the Eoraptor! Did you know that despite its small size, it was a very fast and agile hunter? And imagine, its size was no bigger than a modern dog! But don't underestimate it, it could win a competition with any dog in a 'who can eat a steak faster' race!" Roxy made her narration not only informative but also entertaining.
      `,
      page11: `
      Watching the Eoraptor through the probe's glass panels, {name} felt a mix of excitement and awe. Seeing a dinosaur hunting in its natural habitat was incredibly captivating. "Roxy, how much could it weigh?" {name} asked, trying to gauge the creature's strength.<!--split-->

      "Oh, the Eoraptor weighed about as much as three large watermelons! Or like two of my robot brothers, if they existed," Roxy replied, making {name} laugh.<!--split-->

      The journey into the past opened a door for {name} into a world she could only dream of, making every moment of this experience unforgettable.<!--split-->

      As their journey continued, {name}’s probe and the other tourists slowly passed a group of Plateosaurus grazing calmly by a waterhole. Roxy, always ready to share knowledge, activated.`,

      **The beginning of the journey**

      Have you ever dreamed of traveling to the past to see how dinosaurs lived? A girl named {name} didn't just dream about it—she believed it was possible.<!--split-->

      One evening, sitting in the cozy living room, {name}, along with her parents, Dad, and Mom, watched a dinosaur program through an AR projector, which made the ancient giants almost real, allowing them to literally walk through their room. The air was filled with magic as they saw in three-dimensional projection how these mighty creatures once ruled the Earth.<!--split-->

      Suddenly, a scientist appeared on the screen, who talked about how the dinosaurs perished. {name} was surprised and simultaneously saddened by the fate of these majestic beings. "How I wish I could see them alive!" she exclaimed when the program ended.<!--split-->

      At that moment, an ad for Astra Horizon flashed on the screen. "Embark on a journey to the age of dinosaurs with a discount!" the promise sounded. The advertisement showed happy tourists taking photos with friendly dinosaurs. {name}'s eyes sparkled with delight, and she immediately started convincing her parents to go on this adventure.<!--split-->

      "Please, let's go! It will be the most incredible adventure of my life!" {name} said enthusiastically. Dad and Mom exchanged glances. They saw how much their daughter wanted this journey and understood that such moments are priceless.<!--split-->

      "Alright," Dad said with a smile. "Let's check our calendars and plan your trip through time."<!--split-->

      Thus began {name}'s great adventure, which she would never forget. She was given the chance not only to see dinosaurs alive but also to touch the mysteries of the distant past.`,

      On the weekend morning, {name}'s house was filled with the anticipation of adventure. The family went to the office of Astra Horizon, where they were warmly greeted and registered {name} for an exciting tour into the past. The company's employees conducted a detailed briefing, explaining the safety rules and the importance of following the guides' instructions. {name} listened attentively, her eyes gleaming with excitement and joy.<!--split-->

      After the briefing, the family was led to a hangar, where shiny capsules—the Astra Horizon research probes—were located. These metallic structures with large glass panels promised a thrilling view of ancient landscapes.<!--split-->

      At this moment, {name}'s path and her parents separated: they stayed in the office to await their daughter's return.`,
      page5: `
      With excitement, {name} climbed into the probe, where she was helped to buckle up. Everything around seemed so unreal—from the cold metal of the capsule to the anticipated journey through time. After the countdown, the capsule came to life, and their movement into the past began.<!--split-->

      **In the Paths of the Triassic Period**

      When the tourist-laden probes landed, they found themselves 240 million years in the past. The staff at the base met them with another briefing and explained the tour program: starting from the Triassic period, moving through the Jurassic, and ending in the Cretaceous.<!--split-->

      This information made {name}'s heart beat even faster. She felt a surge of exhilaration and disbelief at what was happening. Being so close to a world she had only seen through screens and books felt like a dream.`,
      page6: `
      Looking around, {name} felt like an explorer of uncharted lands. The air was filled with an atmosphere of adventure and mysteries, every sound and movement around seemed an invitation to the world of ancient enigmas. She knew these experiences would be among the most vivid in her life.<!--split-->

      Before boarding the probe, each tourist was given a watch with an artificial intelligence named Roxy, who promised to be a reliable guide, historian, and friend for the entire tour.<!--split-->

      "Hello, {name}! You have such beautiful eyes, I'm almost sure they shine brighter than my screen," Roxy's cheerful voice sounded from the watch. {name} couldn't help but smile, listening to the compliment from the artificial intelligence.`,
      page7: `
      As she settled into her probe, which instantly became invisible, {name} felt like she was part of something magical and incredible. The journey to the Triassic period had begun, and Roxy immediately got down to business, sharing fascinating facts about that time.<!--split-->

      "Did you know that the Triassic period lasted about 50 million years and was a time when it could rain for almost 2 million years straight? Can you imagine how many umbrellas you would have needed?" Roxy joked, and {name} laughed, imagining that scenario.<!--split-->

      "The continent at that time was called Pangaea, and it was kind of like a party for all the creatures on the planet—all in one place!" Roxy continued, adding lightness to the story of ancient times.<!--split-->

      As Roxy began to talk about the emergence of the first mammals, ammonites, and belemnites, {name} was amazed by the diversity of life. But the real excitement came when they encountered an Eoraptor—one of the first dinosaurs.<!--split-->

      "And now meet the Eoraptor! Did you know that despite its small size, it was a very fast and agile hunter? And imagine, its size was no bigger than a modern dog! But don't underestimate it, it could win a competition with any dog in a 'who can eat a steak faster' race!" Roxy made her narration not only informative but also entertaining.`,
      page8: `
      Watching the Eoraptor through the probe's glass panels, {name} felt a mix of excitement and awe. Seeing a dinosaur hunting in its natural habitat was incredibly captivating. "Roxy, how much could it weigh?" {name} asked, trying to gauge the creature's strength.<!--split-->

      "Oh, the Eoraptor weighed about as much as three large watermelons! Or like two of my robot brothers, if they existed," Roxy replied, making {name} laugh.<!--split-->

      The journey into the past opened a door for {name} into a world she could only dream of, making every moment of this experience unforgettable.<!--split-->

      As their journey continued, {name}’s probe and the other tourists slowly passed a group of Plateosaurus grazing calmly by a waterhole. Roxy, always ready to share knowledge, activated.`,
